In this room at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, all sound from the outside world is locked out and any sound produced inside is stopped cold.
The background noise in the room is so low that it approaches the lowest threshold theorized by mathematicians, the absolute zero of sound -- the next step down is a vacuum, or the absence of sound.
To achieve extreme silence, the room is designed with an onion-like structure that isolates it from the rest of the building and the outside world.
Anechoic chambers are generally used to test noises and sounds coming from a variety of products with a high degree of scientific reliability.
Microsoft uses it for audio equipment such as microphones, receivers, headphones and speakers, or to analyze clicks and hums from computing devices like keyboards, mice, fans and backlight modules on touch panels and displays.
