President Donald Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, facilitated a payment plan totaling $1.6 million last year to a former Playboy model who says she became pregnant by Elliott Broidy, a leading GOP fundraiser, a source tells CNN.
Keith Davidson, the former attorney for Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, represented the woman, making it the second known "hush money" deal Davidson brokered with Cohen.
The FBI raided Cohen's office, hotel room and home earlier this week.
The FBI raids also sought information that included payments allegedly made to keep women silent about affairs with Trump more than a decade ago.
In February, Cohen admitted having paid $130,000 to Daniels, an adult film actress who alleges that she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006.
