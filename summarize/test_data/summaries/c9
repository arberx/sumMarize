The Houston Rockets might not be the best team in NBA history, but they may be one of the most unique teams we've ever seen.
If we define "superteam performance" to be the top 2 percent of all time, the Rockets—who have been better than 98.8 percent of teams in history—are performing like a superteam.
That they have had such success without a third elite talent—as well as with a plethora of injuries—is what makes them historically unique.
While the Rockets are affected by injuries, they minimize the impact by the way they play and with the way their roster is built.
The end result is that while sometimes the Rockets might be down a weapon or two, or even absent a weapons master, they can still run the same system—a bunch of competent shooters who spread the floor while Paul or Harden work their magic.
