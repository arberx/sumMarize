As recently as last month, the Pope had said he's seen no evidence that a Chilean cleric whom he later made a bishop had witnessed a priest abusing teenagers.
"The Pope goes around the world apologizing for the sexual abuse of children," Cruz told CNN, "but he doesn't do a thing." This is not the first time the Pope has been accused of having a "blind spot" on sexual abuse.
In a trip to Chile last month, Pope Francis angered some survivors' groups and Chilean Catholics by forcefully defending Barros, telling reporters, "There is not a single proof against him, everything is slander."That statement made international headlines, with supporters of victims of clerical sex abuse challenging his suggestion that "proof" is a prerequisite for believing a victim's account.
"The word 'proof' was not the best way to approach a pained heart. I would say 'evidence.' In Barros' case, it was studied. It was restudied. And there is no evidence. And that is what I wanted to say. I don't have evidence to convict. If I convicted without evidence or without moral certainty, I would commit a crime of being a bad judge," Francis said.
The Pope defended his zero-tolerance position on abuse by clergy, saying that he has received two dozen requests for pardon but has not granted any.
