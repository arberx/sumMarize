The resort island of Hainan may become a key proving ground for China’s push to lead the world in electric-vehicle adoption.
China aims to phase out sales of fossil-fuel vehicles in the province, and to accelerate the use of new-energy and energy-saving cars on the island, Xinhua News Agency reported late Saturday, citing an official guideline on reforming the southern province.
China will control the number of vehicles in Hainan in “a scientific way,” in a bid to make the island a place with a “green lifestyle,” according to Xinhua.
China surpassed the U.S. in 2009 as the world’s largest automotive market and in 2015 as the biggest NEV market.
Already the biggest electric-car market, China accounted for more than half of worldwide sales last year.
