Since joining the Big Ten for the 2014-15 season, Maryland has been one of the league’s best teams; the Terps have gone 26-10 in two years of Big Ten play and were a five- and a four-seed in trips to the NCAA Tournament – even though Mark Turgeon hadn’t had much success in his first three years in College Park, all in the ACC.
Point guard Melo Trimble has been instrumental in the turnaround; even though he regressed as a sophomore, he was the leader of an impressive five-man unit: Trimble, transfers Rasheed Suliamon and Robert Carter, versatile senior Jake Layman, and 5* big man Diamond Stone.
As the bubble size and usage distribution suggest, Maryland was a team that relied a lot on those five players: Trimble was the engine on offense but big men Robert Carter and Diamond Stone ate up their fair share of possessions as well.
STARTER (WING) – Justin Jackson (Fr, 6’7, 225): Theoretically capable of playing 3, 4, or maybe even 5, Turgeon will probably play him mostly at the 3 and slide him down to the 4 in certain situations, potential impact player, will be better on defense than offense.
The departing players – Rasheed Suliamon, Jake Layman, Robert Carter, and Diamond Stone – are a lot for any team to withstand, but with how shallow the Terrapin bench was last season, there aren’t any players who played well in their role last season left on the team… besides Melo Trimble.
