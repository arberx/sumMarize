The Houston Rockets might not be the best team in NBA history, but they may be one of the most unique teams we've ever seen.
The Rockets have only two such players in James Harden and Chris Paul, and neither of them has been healthy all season.
So how are the Rockets doing it? Just because the Rockets have succeeded through myriad injuries doesn't necessarily mean they're just as potent when injuries strike.
If the Rockets didn't have so many injuries this season, we very well could be talking about one of the best teams in history.
Six Rockets have made 62 or more.
