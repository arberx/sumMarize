Cohen is set to attend the hearing.
Cohen, through his lawyers, has argued that the government’s policies to protect information covered by the attorney-client privilege are not enough, and that his own lawyers should be allowed to review the seized material before investigators do.
It is unusual, but not unprecedented, for agents to search a lawyer’s records, and there is a policy in place designed to shield information covered by the attorney-client privilege.
That procedure involves having a “taint team” of prosecutors outside the investigation review all the material and separate what is covered by the privilege.
Under the procedure, the taint team would turn over to the case investigators all the material that is relevant and not covered by attorney-client privilege.
