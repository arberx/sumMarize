NASA proposes spending $390 million over five years to build the demo plane and test it over populated areas.

“That’s where NASA said we’ve got to go change the rule, and this is the path to making that happen.” Don’t pack your bags for a supersonic trip just yet.
Still, if everything goes as planned, NASA will test the demo plane over as many as six communities beginning in 2022, Coen says.
“We’ve got a lot of support in NASA and the administration and in Congress for making this happen.
