Air Force.

Why Air Force? Michigan's 31-25 victory against the Falcons in 2012 was a shining exemplar of why you should never schedule them.

A befuddled Michigan defense was repeatedly gashed.

Air Force OL loped downfield on passes so far and so frequently that illegal man downfield penalties have become an MGoBlog hobby-horse.

Michigan, 39-16.
