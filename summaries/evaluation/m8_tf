In the end, each of the five had scored more than ten points per game: Trimble led the way, but with just 14.8 – down from his freshman season.

BENCH (WING) – Jared Nickens (Jr, 6’7, 205): Just a shooter, but only shot 35% from deep last season (down from 39% as a freshman), struggles with his shot were an underrated subplot of Maryland’s season last year.

The players listed in the chart below are guys who had multiple seasons show up in Trimble’s Top 30.

It would be a surprise if Maryland didn’t slide a little bit after receiving good NCAA Tournament seeds in the past two seasons.

Great point guard play goes a long way, but until a few players step up, it’s hard to consider this much more than a bubble team entering the season.
