He’s a player who’s at his best while attacking and getting to the free-throw line, and there are few players who will be able to create a shot for themselves or for others in a way that comes even close to replicating what Trimble can do.
The players listed in the chart below are guys who had multiple seasons show up in Trimble’s Top 30.
The departing players – Rasheed Suliamon, Jake Layman, Robert Carter, and Diamond Stone – are a lot for any team to withstand, but with how shallow the Terrapin bench was last season, there aren’t any players who played well in their role last season left on the team… besides Melo Trimble.
If there’s anyone in the Big Ten that could perhaps singlehandedly drag his team towards an NCAA Tournament spot, it’s Trimble.
Great point guard play goes a long way, but until a few players step up, it’s hard to consider this much more than a bubble team entering the season.
