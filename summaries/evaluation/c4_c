And I, for one, am interested in seeing Facebook address this wrong, given my own experience with Cambridge Analytica.
But the actions of Cambridge Analytica are just one piece of the Facebook puzzle that will be taken apart during the congressional hearings.
Senator Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, sees the Zuckerberg testimony as a moment of reckoning, calling it "high noon for Facebook and the tech industry." However, the question is not what Zuckerberg is going to do to survive the anticipated political grandstanding by members of Congress, but what Facebook is going to do to protect privacy and retain the trust of its 2 billion users.
To address the data breach, Facebook has taken steps to safeguard user privacy by putting stronger protections in place -- beginning with updating the site's privacy settings.
In addition, they plan to investigate all apps with access to large amounts of information, restrict access to user data and ensure users are aware of who has access to their personal data.
