An artificial intelligence algorithm using Google Inc.’s image search has proved capable of diagnosing malignant skin lesions as accurately as a group of 21 certified dermatologists.
Innovator Brett Kuprel Age: 26 Electrical engineering Ph.D. student at Stanford Location: Palo Alto Origin Kuprel began tinkering with lesion diagnostics as a way to refine a cancer-detecting neural net, an AI designed to mimic the brain.
Augmentation Dermatologist Rob Novoa, who co-authored a paper on Kuprel’s AI in the journal Nature, says he hopes a diagnostic bot can speed the classification part of his clinical work, so he can see more patients and spend more time with them.
Headwinds A skin-scanning AI might be able to reduce the number of surgeries patients need, but biopsies remain an extremely reliable means of detection—and revenue source—for hospitals, says Adam Friedman, a dermatology professor at George Washington University.
But venture capitalist Robert Mittendorff, whose firm has invested in companies that make hospital software and online therapies, predicts that machines will eventually outpace niche specialists.
