After three years of construction, the world's largest cruise ship just set sail from Barcelona, Spain, on its inaugural voyage to destinations around the Mediterranean.
But the ship's record-breaking size isn't the only thing that the Symphony of the Seas has going for it.
"Eight out of 10 of the largest ships in the world were built by Royal Caribbean, but this one really pushes the envelope," says Yeung.
But the jewel in the crown is the spiraling "Ultimate Abyss" slide -- the tallest on any cruise ship to date, at 150 feet above sea level.
Come autumn, Symphony of the Seas will move its home base to Miami, Florida, and launch a series of Caribbean cruises.
