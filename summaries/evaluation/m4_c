After an ugly first half, the Wolverines took it to Michigan State to secure a season sweep and a shot at their second consecutive Big Ten Tournament title.
Michigan stayed close with defense, holding the Spartans to 11-for-31 shooting themselves, but Wagner's wonky shot and MSU's strong offensive rebounding portended bad things.
Beilein ran much of the offense through Wagner to open the second half, and he responded with five points in five minutes.
"Just make one shot. We played with each other like that. He just smiled: Yes, Coach, I can do that." Michigan State could only inch closer; they didn't get the margin lower than five points in the game's final seven minutes.
Though offensive rebounds ruined some of Michigan's better defensive possessions in the first half, they still managed to hold State below a point per possession in each half.
