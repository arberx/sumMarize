"It was a sweet sight to see Zavier's shots just go right through the middle," said John Beilein.

"Of his foul shots the last couple of days, maybe 8-for-10 or 10-for-12, shooting it right down the middle".

Moe Wagner went scoreless on seven shots in 12 first-half minutes and M was a woeful 4-for-18 from beyond the arc; Simpson was the only Wolverine to hit more than two shots in the opening stanza.

Beilein ran much of the offense through Wagner to open the second half, and he responded with five points in five minutes.

"I told him, this is my great motivation at halftime, hey, Moe, are you going to make a shot? Because right now you're stinking the place up," said Beilein.
