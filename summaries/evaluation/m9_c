Jourdan Lewis did not make a normal play.
"He was able to hang in the air and make a spectacular play." Was Harbaugh upset given Lewis could've improved M's field position by simply batting the ball down? "I'm really glad [he caught it] because it was a spectacular, spectacular football play." Field position be damned, Lewis's incredible play allowed Michigan to run out the clock in a stressful, mistake-filled one-score win.
Speight uncorked his best throw of the day, hitting Darboh in stride for the eventual winning score.
"Wilton put a perfect ball in and I just had to run underneath it." "I saw single-high one-on-one with Darboh." said Speight.
"It was a game ball for Don Brown kind of a game," said Harbaugh.
