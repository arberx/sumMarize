Running full speed in man coverage against George Rushing, Lewis appeared to leap far too early on a deep shot down the middle.

Three missed field goals, two by Kenny Allen and one by replacement Ryan Tice, were partially to blame for the tight score.

Speight uncorked his best throw of the day, hitting Darboh in stride for the eventual winning score.

"It was perfect," said Darboh.

"Wilton put a perfect ball in and I just had to run underneath it." "I saw single-high one-on-one with Darboh." said Speight.
