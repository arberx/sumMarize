John Beilein’s entering his tenth season at Michigan – making him the fourth-longest tenured coach in the Big Ten.

Even without LeVert for almost the entirety of conference play (as well as Spike Albrecht, who was also sidelined by injury), Michigan scraped together an NCAA Tournament resume that was good enough to barely get the Wolverines in as one of the last four teams – forced to play in the “First Four” in Dayton.

Michigan’s mediocre conference efficiency margin (+0.4) suggests that they were lucky to get in.

Ultimately, this seems like a high-floor, low-ceiling type team: unless there’s significant defensive improvement, it’s hard to envision a leap back into the conference’s top tier.

If the Wolverines can play defense – a big “if” – they could perhaps be the biggest surprise in the conference.
