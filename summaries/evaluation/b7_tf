3 House Republican, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, said he wouldnâ€™t run against McCarthy in a contest for House speaker or, if Republicans lose the majority to Democrats in November, as minority leader.
In the current House, which has 237 Republicans, the Freedom caucus sways enough votes to keep any candidate from getting a majority vote needed to ascend to House Speaker should Ryan step down before his term is up in January.
Conservative Support Other conservatives who are not members of the Freedom Caucus, such as Walter Jones of North Carolina, also said they would support Jordan if he ran.
Staunch conservatives such as Jordan and Meadows tend to represent Republican strongholds, and so they likely will end up with greater influence within the GOP House ranks.
Under House Republican rules, when there are more than two candidates for any office and none receives a majority of the votes on the first ballot, the candidate with the lowest number of votes on that, and each succeeding ballot, will be dropped until one candidate receives a majority of the votes.
