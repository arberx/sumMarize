House Speaker Paul Ryan delivered a firm endorsement of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to succeed him as the House GOP leader next year as a group of conservative Republicans said they’re considering a bid to block the choice in order to build their own influence.
3 House Republican, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, said he wouldn’t run against McCarthy in a contest for House speaker or, if Republicans lose the majority to Democrats in November, as minority leader.
Jordan said his main goal, as he considers running, is to get party leaders to stick to a conservative agenda.
“Jim has the right to run, Freedom Caucus has a role to play in the party, I just think that they’ve overplayed their hand.” The introduction of a potential third candidacy could make the post-election closed-door vote for Republican party leader -- either in late November or early December -- more complicated.
In an interview Friday, Jordan declined to discuss whether, in a potential bid by him for party leader, he might consider cutting a deal with another candidate that would have him accepting another top job, such as majority leader.
