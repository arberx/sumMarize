House Speaker Paul Ryan delivered a firm endorsement of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to succeed him as the House GOP leader next year as a group of conservative Republicans said they’re considering a bid to block the choice in order to build their own influence.
3 House Republican, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, said he wouldn’t run against McCarthy in a contest for House speaker or, if Republicans lose the majority to Democrats in November, as minority leader.
In the current House, which has 237 Republicans, the Freedom caucus sways enough votes to keep any candidate from getting a majority vote needed to ascend to House Speaker should Ryan step down before his term is up in January.
“Jim has the right to run, Freedom Caucus has a role to play in the party, I just think that they’ve overplayed their hand.” The introduction of a potential third candidacy could make the post-election closed-door vote for Republican party leader -- either in late November or early December -- more complicated.
Under House Republican rules, when there are more than two candidates for any office and none receives a majority of the votes on the first ballot, the candidate with the lowest number of votes on that, and each succeeding ballot, will be dropped until one candidate receives a majority of the votes.
