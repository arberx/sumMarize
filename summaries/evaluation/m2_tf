It's a list I don't even have to keep, because it is so narrow.

A list gets written down.

When you can count the number of persons given TOP SECRET access to the HUG PROTOCOL on your hands—and you could probably have had a finger lopped off in a bag accident and still gotten by—it's not really a list.

It's an iron-clad fact of life.

YMMV.
