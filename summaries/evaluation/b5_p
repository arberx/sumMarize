By 2025, the consensus goes, the scientific joint venture should be able to create and sustain a fusion reaction that produces more energy than it took to start, a major step toward making fusion a sustainable way to run the world’s power plants.
The U.S. has spent more than $1 billion on ITER since its 2006 inception, according to a 2016 report from the U.S. Department of Energy, but that leaves about $3.5 billion of its commitment left to allocate, and federal investments in fusion research are waning.
The ITER researchers are designing their fusion reactor to produce a series of self-sustaining nuclear reactions, known as a burning plasma.
(ITER didn’t respond to a request for comment.) Since 2015, a new director-general, French nuclear physicist Bernard Bigot, has helped turn the project around and justify further U.S. investment, former Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz wrote in a report to President Obama last year.
“ITER will deliver,” says Juergen Rapp, a plasma physicist who works at Oak Ridge but isn’t involved in the ITER project.
