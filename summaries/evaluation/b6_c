President Donald Trump’s outrage over another apparent chemical weapons attack by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was clear.
“Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.
In a private meeting with Trump and national security officials earlier in the week, Haley was a leading voice pushing for a robust military response to the chemical weapons attack on humanitarian grounds, the person said.
Trump, who just a week earlier said he wanted to pull U.S. troops out of Syria “very soon,” didn’t want to become drawn into the civil war there and instead focused the military response on deterring the use of chemical weapons, according to the official.
Haley, the UN ambassador, said this week that Assad has used chemical weapons dozens of times since war broke out in 2011.
