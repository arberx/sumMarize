If we define "superteam performance" to be the top 2 percent of all time, the Rockets—who have been better than 98.8 percent of teams in history—are performing like a superteam.
By comparison, the Rockets have started 16 different lineups, have played their preferred starters (Paul, Harden, Trevor Ariza, Ryan Anderson or PJ Tucker, and Clint Capela) just 33 times, have lost 52 starts to injury and have missed 99 games from their top eight rotation players.
I looked at every team with an SRS higher than the Rockets' 8.6 or at least 64 wins to see how many minutes were played by an "elite" player, meaning anyone who had ever been named to an All-Star, All-NBA or All-Defensive team.
Before, there was always the thought, "Our best guy can beat your best guy." Modern defenses are built to stop that strategy, as switches and helpers are designed to take away "your best guy." There's a subtle difference in the way the Rockets operate, though, in that they also think, "Our worst guy will beat your worst guy." There's a domino effect at play.
Ariza nets 40.1 percent of his catch-and-shoot treys, Anderson 39.3 percent, Tucker 38.2 percent, Green 36.5 percent and Mbah a Moute 35.5 percent.
