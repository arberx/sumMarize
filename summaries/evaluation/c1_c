It all comes down to one letter, and whether or not Pope Francis read it.
In it, he details years of abuse, witnessed, Cruz says, by the man Pope Francis later made a bishop, Juan Barros.
"Pope Francis needs to make dramatic changes in the way in which the Vatican investigates crimes, especially those by bishops." "Holy Father, I decided to write you this letter because I'm tired of fighting, crying and suffering." That's how Cruz, who now lives in Philadelphia, opened his eight-page letter to the Pope.
Barros "was a witness to all of this I have told you," Cruz writes in his letter to the Pope.
Cruz said O'Malley told him he had handed the letter to Pope Francis in 2015.
