Footage of the meeting broadcast by state television showed an animated Assad smiling and laughing as he met with the Russians.
“President Assad was in absolutely positive spirits.
The meeting came a day after U.S.-led strikes, launched together with Britain and France, hit three Syrian chemical weapons facilities.
In the meeting with the Russians, Assad said that the strikes had demonstrated that Russian weapons were superior to U.S. ones, according to the lawmakers.
As the justification for Saturday’s strikes, the United States and its allies cited what they said was “proof” that the Syrian government had carried out the attack.
