More than 70 years later, these 100-odd researchers are focused on nuclear fusion, the other side of that atomic coin.
“With twice the money, we can definitely do it twice as fast” “It’s not just empty words, it’s actually a reality,” says Ned Sauthoff, the plasma physicist heading the U.S. research unit.
The ITER researchers are designing their fusion reactor to produce a series of self-sustaining nuclear reactions, known as a burning plasma.
ITER isn’t the world’s only nuclear fusion project.
“ITER will deliver,” says Juergen Rapp, a plasma physicist who works at Oak Ridge but isn’t involved in the ITER project.
