Federal officials say nearly 207 million eggs have been recalled because of fears that they may have been contaminated with salmonella, a type of bacteria that causes serious illnesses and deaths, particularly among children and elderly people.
Twenty-two people on the East Coast have been sickened by Salmonella braenderup.
DeCoster were recalled that year.
Last month, the CDC investigated another salmonella outbreak that involved raw coconut and sickened 13 people in eight states.
Salmonella can come from contaminated animal products such as beef, poultry, milk and eggs, as well as fruits and vegetables.
