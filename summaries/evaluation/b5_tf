The ITER researchers are designing their fusion reactor to produce a series of self-sustaining nuclear reactions, known as a burning plasma.
ITER, the biggest tokamak yet, is designed to be the first self-sustaining one.
Even when the ITER funding was in less danger, things didn’t always go according to plan.
ITER isn’t the world’s only nuclear fusion project.
“ITER will deliver,” says Juergen Rapp, a plasma physicist who works at Oak Ridge but isn’t involved in the ITER project.
