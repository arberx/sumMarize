In the rolling hills of East Tennessee, a team of scientists and engineers is working to create a sun on Earth.
They’re at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, once an integral part of the Manhattan Project’s experiments with nuclear fission.
More than 70 years later, these 100-odd researchers are focused on nuclear fusion, the other side of that atomic coin.
They say they and their counterparts in the European Union, Russia, and China are less than a decade away from a successful demo of the technology needed to build a reactor that generates a city’s worth of energy and emits zero carbon.
The project in Tennessee feeds into work on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or ITER, a collaboration among 35 countries that’s under construction in the south of France.
