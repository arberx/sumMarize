"He was able to hang in the air and make a spectacular play." Was Harbaugh upset given Lewis could've improved M's field position by simply batting the ball down? "I'm really glad [he caught it] because it was a spectacular, spectacular football play." Field position be damned, Lewis's incredible play allowed Michigan to run out the clock in a stressful, mistake-filled one-score win.
Some of the blame also fell on Speight, who'd been scattershot for most of the afternoon and forced a ball to Jake Butt that got tipped and picked off to set up UW's only score, a perfectly thrown wheel route to Dare Ogunbowale.
"Wilton put a perfect ball in and I just had to run underneath it." "I saw single-high one-on-one with Darboh." said Speight.
Harbaugh clearly felt comfortable putting the game in the hands of Don Brown; the Wolverines ran three straight times, then Allen pinned the Badgers at the own eight-yard line.
"It was a game ball for Don Brown kind of a game," said Harbaugh.
