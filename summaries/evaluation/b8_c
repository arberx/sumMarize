Apple outlined situations in which information was leaked to the media, including a meeting earlier this year where Apple’s software engineering head Craig Federighi told employees that some planned iPhone software features would be delayed.
“We want the chance to tell our customers why the product is great, and not have that done poorly by someone else,” Greg Joswiak, an Apple product marketing executive, said in the memo.
The employee who leaked the meeting to a reporter later told Apple investigators that he did it because he thought he wouldn’t be discovered.
A scoop about an unreleased Apple product can generate massive traffic for a publication and financially benefit the blogger or reporter who broke it.
“Seeing it leak is devastating for all of us.” The impact of a leak goes beyond the people who work on a particular project — it’s felt throughout the company.
