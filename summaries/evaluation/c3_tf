For much of Tesla's lifetime, it's concentrated on growing the company rather than turning a profit.
Both Tesla and Musk have publicly debunked the idea that the company will need to raise more money.
Tesla has predicted it will be building 5,000 Model 3's a week by the end of June, and that it will soon be building 10,000 cars a week, or about a half million a year.
Despite Musk's bold profit forecasts, Tesla (TSLA) shares were only up only 2% in Friday trading.
When Tesla started building the Model 3 in July of last year, Musk predicted the company would churn out 5,000 Model 3's a week by the end of the year.
