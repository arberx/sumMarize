But the ship's record-breaking size isn't the only thing that the Symphony of the Seas has going for it.
"Eight out of 10 of the largest ships in the world were built by Royal Caribbean, but this one really pushes the envelope," says Yeung.
"Central Park is really peaceful, with more than 20,000 tropical plants and an alfresco wine bar," says Yeung.
Come autumn, Symphony of the Seas will move its home base to Miami, Florida, and launch a series of Caribbean cruises.
"This summer, the Symphony is sailing one of the most popular and common Mediterranean itineraries, stopping in established tourist destinations such as Rome and Naples," says Yeung.
