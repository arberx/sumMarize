After three years of construction, the world's largest cruise ship just set sail from Barcelona, Spain, on its inaugural voyage to destinations around the Mediterranean.
"You can actually see it the moment you almost step out of the airport in Barcelona, since the port is just 10 to 15 minutes away. It makes a huge first impression." Ultimate family adventure: The world's largest cruise ship just set sail from Barcelona, Spain, on its inaugural voyage.
"At the same time, you don't really feel crowded because there are 18 decks on the ship. It's like a building, right? There are 24 elevators and seven neighborhoods. Each neighborhood has its own personality, so it tends to naturally segregate the crowds." "Neighborhoods" such as the adults-only Solarium lounge or leafy Central Park aim to provide a refuge, whereas a dedicated Splashaway Bay water park is packed with families.
"It's beautiful to see the outdoor dives at the back of the ship, with all the lighting and the music and professional acrobatics." When it comes to accommodations, the most over-the-top is the "Ultimate Family Suite." Decked out in bold colors, these two-level suites include a host of unusual amenities -- think an in-room slide, private cinema, ping pong table and floor-to-ceiling LEGO wall.
On the itinerary? Stops in Bora Bora or perhaps a "Perfect Day at CocoCay" -- a private island owned by Royal Caribbean that's home to the tallest waterslide in North America, hot air balloon rides and the largest freshwater pool in the Caribbean.
