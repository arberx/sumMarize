The resort island of Hainan may become a key proving ground for China’s push to lead the world in electric-vehicle adoption.
China aims to phase out sales of fossil-fuel vehicles in the province, and to accelerate the use of new-energy and energy-saving cars on the island, Xinhua News Agency reported late Saturday, citing an official guideline on reforming the southern province.
His administration is implementing new-energy vehicle production quotas, targeting a seven-fold increase in NEV sales and considering a ban on gas guzzlers as China tries to clear the air in polluted cities and cut its reliance on imported oil.
Already the biggest electric-car market, China accounted for more than half of worldwide sales last year.
Xi attended the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan, often referred to as China’s Hawaii, and reiterated pledges to open sectors from banking to auto manufacturing.
