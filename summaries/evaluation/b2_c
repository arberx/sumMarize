The resort island of Hainan may become a key proving ground for China’s push to lead the world in electric-vehicle adoption.
China aims to phase out sales of fossil-fuel vehicles in the province, and to accelerate the use of new-energy and energy-saving cars on the island, Xinhua News Agency reported late Saturday, citing an official guideline on reforming the southern province.
The guideline coincides with President Xi Jinping’s visit to the island, and initiatives include setting up a trial free-trade zone and building up Hainan’s tourism industry.
While the report didn’t give details or a timeline on the fossil fuel-vehicle ban, the initiative fits with Xi’s broader campaign to promote electric autos.
China surpassed the U.S. in 2009 as the world’s largest automotive market and in 2015 as the biggest NEV market.
