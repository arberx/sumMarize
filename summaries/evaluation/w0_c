BEIRUT — Syrian President Bashar al-Assad praised Russian weaponry on Sunday as his government celebrated victory over rebels in the town where an alleged chemical attack took place, triggering U.S. airstrikes over the weekend.
The meeting came a day after U.S.-led strikes, launched together with Britain and France, hit three Syrian chemical weapons facilities.
In the meeting with the Russians, Assad said that the strikes had demonstrated that Russian weapons were superior to U.S. ones, according to the lawmakers.
[Chlorine, sarin or something else? The big questions in the alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack.] The Syrian president’s high spirits were matched by displays of jubilation in Damascus, where government supporters took to the streets on Saturday to demonstrate their backing for Assad and express scorn for the strikes.
The rebels in the town surrendered the day after the alleged chemical attack, and Russian troops have since been overseeing an evacuation deal under which rebels and anti-government activists were bussed to rebel-held areas in northern Syria.
