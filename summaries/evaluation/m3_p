Using data from Hoop Lens, here are Michigan's offensive stats with Teske on the floor before and after the trip to Madison (top-100 non-conf. games and Big Ten only): There's noise in here, to be sure—the nearly ten-point gap in three-point shooting should be attributed more to luck than anything Teske is doing.
Charles Matthews going left off the dribble surely caught the MSU defense off guard, but Teske ensured it ended in a dunk by flipping his screen and effectively cutting off the path of both Miles Bridges and Xavier Tillman: He helped Simpson get a bucket on Tum Tum Nairn by once again flipping the pick, then boxing out Tillman after slipping to the basket and gaining inside position.
Teske, who'd been looking for an entry pass, recognizes this and gets into position to pick off a defender, giving Matthews the space to rise and fire: Here's one more just to show not everything has to go to the rim when Teske's out there: a three-pointer by MAAR after he doubles back off the initial screen and executes a quick give-and-go.
UMHoops' Ethan Sears found that's made Matthews a much more effective offensive player [emphasis mine]: In the five games leading up to March Madness, Matthews’ usage rate has hovered around 17 percent, per Bart Torvik, well below his season average of 25.3%.
This play early in the shot clock is a great example, even though it initially looks like aimless dribbling: I'll leave it to Ant Wright to describe what happened here: Great slow to quick tempo by Poole to create the action for either Teske or Matthews.. defense bit on Teske, Poole hits Matthews That’s next level defense reading Poole's hard crossover didn't just draw the two defenders involved in the pick-and-roll, it also caused Dakota Mathias to help off Matthews in the corner.
