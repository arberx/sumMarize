The best thing about their resume was the lack of truly bad losses, and Ohio State was the only team that wasn’t tournament-quality to beat Michigan.

Since there are minutes to be had as a third center, at least one will probably play.

While Michigan’s an undersized team, it wouldn’t be impossible for them to cobble together an adequate defense.

It really does come down to the defense.

At worst, the offense will be pretty good – something that can’t be said of the defense.
