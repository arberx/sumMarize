It all comes down to one letter, and whether or not Pope Francis read it.
In it, he details years of abuse, witnessed, Cruz says, by the man Pope Francis later made a bishop, Juan Barros.
Barros "was a witness to all of this I have told you," Cruz writes in his letter to the Pope.
Cruz said O'Malley told him he had handed the letter to Pope Francis in 2015.
Later, though, Francis seemed to indicate that the church does not have all the evidence in Barros' case.
