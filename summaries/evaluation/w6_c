The deficits — the gap between what government spends and what it collects in taxes — average about 5 percent of the economy (gross domestic product, or GDP).
Adding these amounts to government borrowing would increase the federal debt — the total of all past deficits — to more than 100 percent of GDP, about as large as right after World War II.
They warned of an approaching “debt crisis” if ballooning budget deficits weren’t reversed.
In today’s dollars, balancing the budget would require annual spending cuts and tax increases of about $1 trillion.
That’s equal to about a fifth of federal spending, which is now being borrowed.
