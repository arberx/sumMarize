Elon Musk says he's finally ready to start making money.
For much of Tesla's lifetime, it's concentrated on growing the company rather than turning a profit.
Both Tesla and Musk have publicly debunked the idea that the company will need to raise more money.
Still the Jefferies analysts aren't the only ones wondering if Tesla is running out of money.
Instead, it had only built a total of 2,700 by the end of 2017.
