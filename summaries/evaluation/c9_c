The Houston Rockets might not be the best team in NBA history, but they may be one of the most unique teams we've ever seen.
The Rockets have only two such players in James Harden and Chris Paul, and neither of them has been healthy all season.
I looked at every team with an SRS higher than the Rockets' 8.6 or at least 64 wins to see how many minutes were played by an "elite" player, meaning anyone who had ever been named to an All-Star, All-NBA or All-Defensive team.
If you only consider the games Paul and Harden have played, it's plus-11.0, and Houston is 44-5 in those contests.
If the Rockets didn't have so many injuries this season, we very well could be talking about one of the best teams in history.
