Federal officials say nearly 207 million eggs have been recalled because of fears that they may have been contaminated with salmonella, a type of bacteria that causes serious illnesses and deaths, particularly among children and elderly people.
The recall is the largest since 2010, when a major salmonella outbreak tied to Iowa egg farms sickened more than 1,500 people, said Bill Marler a Seattle-based personal injury attorney who focuses on food-borne illness litigation.
Earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration ordered a mandatory recall of all food products that contained powdered kratom after investigators found that several products manufactured by Las Vegas-based Triangle Pharmanaturals contained salmonella.
Last month, the CDC investigated another salmonella outbreak that involved raw coconut and sickened 13 people in eight states.
The outbreak resulted in 265 illnesses in eight states.
