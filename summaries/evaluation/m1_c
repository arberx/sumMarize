They scored 99 points, the most Texas A&M has allowed this season, on an astonishing 1.38 points per possession.

Wagner was the star of the first half, pouring in 14 of his 21 while seemingly gaining confidence with every shot, the most spectacular a running left-handed bank after his patented behind-the-back dribble.

"I think we're a very confident team, and I think that's all that matters," said Wagner.

No matter which team advances, the Wolverines will enter the game knowing they can—and should—win.

Given how they've played over the last month or so, they're not wrong.
