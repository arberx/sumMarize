"The Pope goes around the world apologizing for the sexual abuse of children," Cruz told CNN, "but he doesn't do a thing." This is not the first time the Pope has been accused of having a "blind spot" on sexual abuse.
"Pope Francis needs to make dramatic changes in the way in which the Vatican investigates crimes, especially those by bishops." "Holy Father, I decided to write you this letter because I'm tired of fighting, crying and suffering." That's how Cruz, who now lives in Philadelphia, opened his eight-page letter to the Pope.
In a statement dated January 30, Barros' diocese said, "The Bishop ... expressed that he is taking everything related to the Pope with faith and joy, asking God for the truth to shine through and especially invoking the Virgin Mary so everyone can reach peace." Collins said it was a mistake for Pope Francis to appoint Barros a bishop in 2015.
"If he saw what was happening and didn't seem to recognize it as abuse, then putting him in charge of a diocese where he oversees the safety of children is a problem." In a trip to Chile last month, Pope Francis angered some survivors' groups and Chilean Catholics by forcefully defending Barros, telling reporters, "There is not a single proof against him, everything is slander." That statement made international headlines, with supporters of victims of clerical sex abuse challenging his suggestion that "proof" is a prerequisite for believing a victim's account.
Francis' comments elicited a rare public rebuke from O'Malley, the Pope's top adviser on sexual abuse, who called them "a source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse by clergy." 'He risks it all crashing down' Questions about Barros dominated a news conference held on the papal plane during the Pope's return to Rome following his visit to Chile and Peru.
