So it might be Providential that Pope Francis chose to make news last week in two ways.
There was thus an instructive symmetry between what Francis said in his Apostolic Exhortation Gaudete et Exsultate ("Rejoice and Be Glad") and his own moment of necessary penance.
In this case, the task fell to Cardinal Sean O’Malley, a close Francis ally.
Francis responded with a letter to Chile’s bishops.
Perhaps Francis can inspire in them some self-examination — and, more importantly, provoke a badly needed rebellion by the decent people who represent "the middle class of holiness."
