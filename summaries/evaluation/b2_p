The resort island of Hainan may become a key proving ground for China’s push to lead the world in electric-vehicle adoption.
China will control the number of vehicles in Hainan in “a scientific way,” in a bid to make the island a place with a “green lifestyle,” according to Xinhua.
While the report didn’t give details or a timeline on the fossil fuel-vehicle ban, the initiative fits with Xi’s broader campaign to promote electric autos.
China surpassed the U.S. in 2009 as the world’s largest automotive market and in 2015 as the biggest NEV market.
Already the biggest electric-car market, China accounted for more than half of worldwide sales last year.
