First, he did something that comes very hard to most public figures, and particularly to the current occupant of the White House: He apologized fervently for "grave errors." He also issued a remarkable document on holiness that seemed made for the moment — and, by the way, noted that we can "waste precious time" by being caught up in "superficial information" and "instant communication." Francis continued to preach his gospel of economic justice by warning that it is a "harmful ideological error" to cast "the social engagement of others" as "worldly, secular, materialist, communist or populist." On the contrary, he saw holiness as demanding an engagement with "the destitute, the abandoned and the underprivileged." And he lifted up words from Leviticus we are unlikely to hear cited by President Trump: "When a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress him." It’s not often that public figures hold themselves to the standards they apply to others.
Many of us who admire Francis feared that his apparent standing up for the indefensible was a sign that the 81-year-old pontiff was incapable of recognizing the Church’s profound breach of trust when it placed institutional self-preservation above a concern for the suffering of those abused by priests.
This enhanced the credibility of Francis’s exhortation to the rest of us to imitate the humble day-to-day saints whom he referred to as "the middle class of holiness." He reiterated that the Church would continue to defend "the innocent unborn" but stressed the importance of seeing the "lives of the poor, those already born," as "equally sacred." Francis added pointedly that while "a politician looking for votes" might see "the situation of migrants" as "a secondary issue compared to the ‘grave’ bioethical questions," a true Christian would not.
It was hard to miss the message to U.S. bishops that letting antiabortion politicians off the hook on immigration and refugees would be a denial of their obligation "to stand in the shoes of those brothers and sisters of ours who risk their lives to offer a future to their children." Francis insisted that "the most decisive turning points in world history are substantially co-determined by souls whom no history book ever mentions." That’s excellent news, because in our era, many whom the history books will mention are leading us nowhere good.
Perhaps Francis can inspire in them some self-examination — and, more importantly, provoke a badly needed rebellion by the decent people who represent "the middle class of holiness."
