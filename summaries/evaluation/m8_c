There’s a nagging sense that they underachieved though.

BENCH (WING) – Jared Nickens (Jr, 6’7, 205): Just a shooter, but only shot 35% from deep last season (down from 39% as a freshman), struggles with his shot were an underrated subplot of Maryland’s season last year.

He’s been the catalyst for Maryland for each of the past two years and his statistical profile is reminiscent of some of the Big Ten’s best point guards over the last decade or so – a junior Roy Devyn Marble and seniors Jordan Taylor and Tim Frazier are a solid top three.

It would be a surprise if Maryland didn’t slide a little bit after receiving good NCAA Tournament seeds in the past two seasons.

When the Maryland offense bogs down, he could put his head down and get to the rim – with a James Harden-esque herky-jerky driving style, he baits defenders into fouling him; while it’s not an enjoyable brand of basketball to watch, a guard who can seemingly get to the free throw line at will is a huge asset in college basketball.
