Since joining the Big Ten for the 2014-15 season, Maryland has been one of the league’s best teams; the Terps have gone 26-10 in two years of Big Ten play and were a five- and a four-seed in trips to the NCAA Tournament – even though Mark Turgeon hadn’t had much success in his first three years in College Park, all in the ACC.
While Trimble falls short of the very best Big Ten point guards – for example, Trey Burke’s sophomore season doesn’t show up anywhere near the top – he’s at that next tier.
The departing players – Rasheed Suliamon, Jake Layman, Robert Carter, and Diamond Stone – are a lot for any team to withstand, but with how shallow the Terrapin bench was last season, there aren’t any players who played well in their role last season left on the team… besides Melo Trimble.
If there’s anyone in the Big Ten that could perhaps singlehandedly drag his team towards an NCAA Tournament spot, it’s Trimble.
Great point guard play goes a long way, but until a few players step up, it’s hard to consider this much more than a bubble team entering the season.
