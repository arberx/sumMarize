Lewis caught this, somehow.

[Patrick Barron/MGoBlog] A normal recap would probably fixate on Wilton Speight and Amara Darboh totally redeeming themselves.

Jourdan Lewis did not make a normal play.

On Wisconsin's last-gasp fourth-and-ten, Lewis made an interception that ranks up there with Charles Woodson's against Michigan State.

It also provided the opportunity for an all-time highlight.
