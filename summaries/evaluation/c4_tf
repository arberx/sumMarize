Facebook is already taking steps to address concerns over privacy, safety and the sanctity of democracy.
And I, for one, am interested in seeing Facebook address this wrong, given my own experience with Cambridge Analytica.
Cambridge Analytica simply operated as data scientists on Wilson's team.
But the actions of Cambridge Analytica are just one piece of the Facebook puzzle that will be taken apart during the congressional hearings.
To address the data breach, Facebook has taken steps to safeguard user privacy by putting stronger protections in place -- beginning with updating the site's privacy settings.
