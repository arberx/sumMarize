(Deb Lindsey/For The Washington Post) (Good/Excellent) There are plenty of reasons anyone who cares about good food should explore Chloe, the debut restaurant from veteran Washington chef Haidar Karoum.
[Which is better, Cracker Barrel or Applebee’s? Our critic ranks America’s most popular chains.] Toast is enjoying Stormy Daniels-level attention right now, and Chloe is fueling the fashion with house-baked grilled bread lavished with creamy sheep’s milk ricotta, “really raw” honey, fresh rosemary and a drizzle of olive oil — basically a DIY open-faced cheese sandwich that sends your taste buds to summer camp.
Gumbo might look out of place, but not when Karoum shares more of his résumé: While working decades ago at 219 restaurant in Old Town Alexandria, he fell hard for the seafood gumbo, his rendition of which at Chloe has my mind wandering to New Orleans for the duration of the bowl.
(Deb Lindsey/For The Washington Post) India has long been my favorite journey, which makes cod beneath a carpet of crushed papadum my dish of choice at Chloe.
Did I mention that the bed of rice is as impressive as the enchiladas? Introduced as a staff meal by sous-chef Cecilia Carrasco Mitchell, whose husband is the ever-suave general manager Tyler Mitchell, they’re sure to become a hit, along with the very good banh mi, available with crisp tofu and mushrooms or with pork shoulder and pâté.
