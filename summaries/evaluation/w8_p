RICHMOND — Christy Coleman spends a lot of time among artifacts of the Civil War, and two that touch her deeply are a pair of tattered Confederate battle flags.
Both relics hint at deeper human stories, and that’s where Coleman finds meaning in her job as chief executive of the American Civil War Museum, an institution created from the ruins of this city’s Confederate ironworks.
Coleman is helping lead a commission appointed by Richmond’s mayor to recommend what to do with five enormous statues of Confederate leaders along the city’s grandest residential boulevard, Monument Avenue.
“America’s reckoning with her sin and her trauma,” Coleman said, “is really what we’ve got to get to.” Giving voice to the voiceless Coleman, 53, grew up in Williamsburg, in the workaday city behind Ye Olde Colonial Facade.
“The problem is, too many people have tried to position the American Civil War . . . as their own personal story.” Every statue, every artifact, can contain a world of different meanings to different people.
