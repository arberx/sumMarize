8: Devin Bush (#1 Florida, T2 Cincinnati, T2 Air Force, #1 Purdue) 5: Chase Winovich(#1 Air Force, #2a Purdue) 3: Mason Cole (#1, Cincinnati), Ty Isaac (#2, Florida, #3 Cincinnati) 2: Quinn Nordin (#3 Florida, #3 Air Force), John O'Korn (#2 Purdue) 1: Khaleke Hudson (T2 Cincinnati), Tyree Kinnel (T2 Cincinnati), Mike McCray(T2 Air Force), Sean McKeon(T3 Purdue), Zach Gentry (T3 Purdue).
Honorable mention: O'Korn's arcing bomb to Gentry; redzone touchdown 1, 2, or 3; Chris Evans puts the game to bed with a 50-yard TD; Devin Bush thunders into the backfield for... lots of stuff; Michigan corners bat down all the passes; MARCUS HALL EPIC DOUBLE BIRD OF THE WEEK.
3/3, nothing structurally wrong with Michigan's approach as they near the goal line, one nice pitch sweep counter for an RPS +2 score, expect Michigan's redzone offense to be about as good as their overall offense, give or take some small sample size issues, the end.
More generally, Purdue came into the game averaging 6 yards per play and 25 first downs a game; Michigan held them to 3.8 and 9 first downs, only 1 in the second half.
Harbaugh on the stick to sports topic du jour: Asked by a reporter after Michigan's 28-10 win over Purdue, Harbaugh called the comments made by Donald Trump Friday night in Alabama "ridiculous." The Michigan coach even offered up a suggestion to Trump, whom he once complimented for being anti-establishment.
