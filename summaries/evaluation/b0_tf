Nervous Russian tycoons may be driving a selloff in the Swiss franc.
The currency’s slide this week has been out of character with its status as a safe asset during times of market turmoil.
The franc has fallen to its weakest level versus the euro since January 2015 while the yen, also a haven, has gained as the U.S. threatened military action in Syria, escalated a trade spat with China and slapped sanctions on Russian oligarchs.
Opposite Directions The Swiss franc declined on a day market stress supported the yen Some market participants who had hedged risks by going long on the Swiss franc and short the ruble may now be unwinding those positions, according to Neil Jones, head of hedge fund sales at Mizuho Bank Ltd.
“People are being stopped out of long franc,” said Jones.
