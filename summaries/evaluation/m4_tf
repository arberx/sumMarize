Everything's coming up Michigan.
According to KenPom, Michigan delivered the third-best defensive performance against MSU this season.
Though offensive rebounds ruined some of Michigan's better defensive possessions in the first half, they still managed to hold State below a point per possession in each half.
Just ask Michigan State.
They're 0-2 against Michigan and 29-2 against everyone else.
