President Donald Trump’s outrage over another apparent chemical weapons attack by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was clear.
Pentagon officials on Saturday said they faced little resistance to their targeted attack on what they said were three Syrian chemical weapons facilities.
“No Syrian weapon had any effect on anything we did,” McKenzie said.
“Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.
Haley, the UN ambassador, said this week that Assad has used chemical weapons dozens of times since war broke out in 2011.
