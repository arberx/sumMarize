It has also found that the prevalence has gone down but is still highest in Hispanic and black youth.
"The prevalence of total dental [cavities] decreased as family income levels increased, from 51.8% for youth from families living below the federal poverty level to 34.2% for youth from families with income levels greater than 300% of the federal poverty level," according to the CDC study.
"The prevalence of untreated dental [cavities] decreased from 18.6% for youth from families living below the federal poverty level to 7.0% for youth from families with incomes greater than 300% of the federal poverty level," the study found.
In order to address this issue, medical professionals are going into communities to offer access to oral health care, educate families and children about the importance of oral health, and help families find dental clinics that are accessible to them.
This is why it is important to help families address whatever issues may be keeping them from seeking oral health care, Mulligan said.
