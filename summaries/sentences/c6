The percentage of young people with dental cavities in the United States dropped from 50% in 2012 to just over 43% in 2016, according to a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Hispanic youths had the most cavities (52%) compared with black (44.3%), Asian (42.6%) and white (39%) youths.
Cavities can lead students to miss school, to not be able to chew properly and to not be able to speak and communicate effectively due to pain, she said.
Why are minorities most at risk? Mulligan cited several reasons why Hispanic and black youth might have the highest prevalence of total and untreated cavities, including socioeconomic status, education level and access to health care.
Families have a lot of competing priorities -- getting food on the table, paying bills, dealing with illness -- and this can cause oral health care to be put on the back burner.
