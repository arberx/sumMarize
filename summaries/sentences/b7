But Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus and a leading congressional critic of the Justice Department’s and FBI’s handling of the Russia-Trump investigation, said Friday he is considering a bid for a leadership post.
Jordan said his main goal, as he considers running, is to get party leaders to stick to a conservative agenda.
In an interview Friday, Jordan declined to discuss whether, in a potential bid by him for party leader, he might consider cutting a deal with another candidate that would have him accepting another top job, such as majority leader.
House Speaker Paul Ryan delivered a firm endorsement of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to succeed him as the House GOP leader next year as a group of conservative Republicans said they’re considering a bid to block the choice in order to build their own influence.
Yan and his allies have been trying to head off a power struggle within the House GOP in the wake of his retirement announcement, which comes as the party is fighting to cling to its majority after November congressional elections.
