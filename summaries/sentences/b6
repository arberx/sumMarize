President Donald Trump’s outrage over another apparent chemical weapons attack by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was clear.

While both vessels carry as many as 90 Tomahawk missiles -- the main weapon used in the Friday evening strike on Syria -- neither ship in the end fired a shot.

In the White House, Trump met with military officials and made several calls to his French and British counterparts with the goal of following through on a threat to impose a “big price’’ on Syria.

The president asked Bolton and the military leaders to justify each potential target, and was particularly focused on limiting the risk of escalation by Russia.

Trump spoke multiple times over the course of the week with French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May.
