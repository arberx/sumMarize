Apple Inc. warned employees to stop leaking internal information on future plans and raised the specter of potential legal action and criminal charges, one of the most-aggressive moves by the world’s largest technology company to control information about its activities.

The Cupertino, California-based company said in a lengthy memo posted to its internal blog that it "caught 29 leakers," last year and noted that 12 of those were arrested.

In 2012, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook pledged to double down on keeping the company’s work under wraps.

In 2017, Apple held a confidential meeting with employees in another bid to stop leaks.

The impact of a leak goes beyond the people who work on a particular project — it’s felt throughout the company.
