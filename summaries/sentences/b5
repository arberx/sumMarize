In the rolling hills of East Tennessee, a team of scientists and engineers is working to create a sun on Earth.
The project in Tennessee feeds into work on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or ITER, a collaboration among 35 countries that’s under construction in the south of France.
By 2025, the consensus goes, the scientific joint venture should be able to create and sustain a fusion reaction that produces more energy than it took to start, a major step toward making fusion a sustainable way to run the world’s power plants.
The biggest obstacle to the world’s fusion-energy future is funding, Sauthoff says.
Inside the reactor’s core, heavy hydrogen atoms—those carrying one or two extra neutrons—will be pressurized and heated to 100 million to 150 million degrees Celsius.
