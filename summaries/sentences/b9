JPMorgan's strategists have positioned for higher oil prices that could last three to six months, before U.S. shale production can respond, rather than for an acute supply cut that delivers subtrend global growth.
"Equity and credit markets probably won't welcome a geopolitical/supply-driven rise to $80 that could persist for several months," they wrote, but it won’t be "an event that drives a bear market in either."
While Brent is up 8 percent in 2018 and more than 30 percent over the past year, those aren’t major moves for such a volatile market, according to JPMorgan.
"Oil is the standout market this month in that it is the only global asset price making new 2018 highs," the strategists wrote.
Brian Barish of Cambiar Investors and James Paulsen of Leuthold Weeden Capital Management have pointed to energy shares having been out of favor in recent years.
Brent oil could spike to $80 a barrel if the U.S. and European Union reimpose sanctions on Iran and as Western powers expand the scope of the Syrian civil war, JPMorgan strategists, led by John Normand, wrote in a note on Friday.
