In August, NASA says, it will begin taking bids for construction of a demo model of a plane able to reduce the sonic boom to something like the hum you’d hear inside a Mercedes-Benz on the interstate.

NASA proposes spending $390 million over five years to build the demo plane and test it over populated areas.

The first year of funding is included in President Trump’s 2018 budget proposal.

Still, if everything goes as planned, NASA will test the demo plane over as many as six communities beginning in 2022, Coen says.

The fourth major obstacle may be Washington, because the language of the 1973 ban will require the FAA or Congress to explicitly undo it even if technology renders it obsolete.
